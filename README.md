# ðŸ“š StudySync Pro â€“ AI-Powered Daily Test Scheduler

This project is a no-code, generative AI app that builds personalized study schedules for any exam using [AWS PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws). Users input the exam subject, number of days to prepare, and daily study hours, and the app returns a custom daily study plan â€” plus a motivational message.

## ðŸ§  BUILD Summary

### ðŸ”¹ B â€“ Background
As someone who recently passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, I wanted to create something helpful for other test-takers. *StudySync Pro* helps students manage their time and energy by building a realistic study schedule with AI.

### ðŸ”¹ U â€“ Understanding
The app accepts 3 inputs:
- Exam Subject
